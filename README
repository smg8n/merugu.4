INTRODUCTION
------------
The goal of this homework is to implement time-based scheduling using message queues for synchronization.

COMPILATION
-----------
To compile, open a new CLI window, change the 
directory nesting your module. Type:

  make
  
To remove object files,type:
  make clean

EXECUTION
---------

To run it simply type: ./oss

Default output log file is 	log.txt
  
The sheduler prevents process aging by making sure it visits each queue and 
visits each process before moving on to schedule more processes making sure each process gets cpu time. 
Every process will get a chance to run each cycle of the scheduler.  
  
The processes run for a small amount of time quantum and terminate.
The processes run for a portion of the quantum and get preempted.
The processes run for a portion of the quantum and get blocked by an incoming event.
The processes run for a full quantum and get rescheduled.
  
  
  
Version Control
----------------------
For Version Control i have used github.
/classes/OS/merugu/merugu.4/git_log

git log has been placed in git_log.txt file
